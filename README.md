## Introduction

Welcome to **SypherAI** — a **next-generation, fully re-engineered evolution** of the beloved [**HoshinoBETA**](https://github.com/itsmeakhiro/HoshinoBETA) framework. Developed from the ground up by [**Francis Loyd Raval**](https://github.com/itsmehoshino), SypherAI introduces **smarter architecture, modular plugins, lightning-fast event handling**, and **AI-powered automation** that pushes the boundaries of Messenger bot development.

 This is not just an upgrade — it's a **complete reinvention** from [**HoshinoBETA**](https://github.com/itsmeakhiro/HoshinoBETA) framework. Every line of code has been rethought, optimized, and future-proofed to support **massive scalability, seamless plugin integration, and real-time adaptability**.

> _**Disclaimer**_: SypherAI is currently in active development (InDev). While extensively tested, unexpected bugs or behavior may occur. Use at your own risk and report issues immediately via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/itsmehoshino/Sypher/issues).

**Why SypherAI?**
- **Performance-first design** with async-native core
- **Zero-downtime plugin system**
- **Built-in AI response engine** (coming soon)
- **Intuitive command & event DSL**
- **Full TypeScript & ESM support**
